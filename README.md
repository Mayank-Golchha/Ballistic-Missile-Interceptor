# 🛡️ Ballistic Missile Interceptor

> *"Intercept before impact."* – A physics-based missile defense simulator built for experimentation, strategy, and fun.

This project simulates an anti-ballistic missile defense system. The goal is to intercept incoming enemy missiles using precision-timed interceptors. It models real-time physics, projectile motion, and impact prediction — all in a visually interactive environment.
